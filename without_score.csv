explanation why the edits made under my username hardcore metallica fan were reverted  they weren t vandalisms  just closure on some gas after i voted at new york dolls fac  and please don t remove the template from the talk page since i m retired now

hey man  i m really not trying to edit war  it s just that this guy is constantly removing relevant information and talking to me through edits instead of my talk page  he seems to care more about the formatting than the actual info 
  more i can t make any real suggestions on improvement i wondered if the section statistics should be later on  or a subsection of types of accidents  i think the references may need tidying so that they are all in the exact same format ie date format etc  i can do that later on  if no one else does first if you have any preferences for formatting style on references or want to do it yourself please let me know there appears to be a backlog on articles for review so i guess there may be a delay until a reviewer turns up  it s listed in the relevant form eg wikipedia good article nominations  trans port 
you  sir  are my hero  any chance you remember what page that s on 
 congratulations from me as well  use the tools well  talk  
cock  suck before you piss around on my work
your vandalism to the matt shirvington article has been reverted please don t do it again  or you will be banned 
sorry if the word  nonsense  was offensive to you  anyway  i m not intending to write anything in the article wow they would jump on me for vandalism i m merely requesting that it be more encyclopedic so one can use it for school as a reference  i have been to the selective breeding page but it s almost a stub  it points to  animal breeding  which is a short messy article that gives you no info  there must be someone around with expertise in eugenics 
alignment on this subject and which are contrary to those of dulithgow
  fair use rationale for image wonju jpg  thanks for uploading image wonju jpg  i notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in wikipedia articles constitutes fair use  in addition to the boilerplate fair use template  you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale if you have uploaded other fair use media  consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too  you can find a list of  image  pages you have edited by clicking on the my contributions link  it is located at the very top of any wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting image from the dropdown box  note that any fair use images uploaded after may and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded  as described on criteria for speedy deletion  if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page  thank you talk contribs unspecified source for image wonju jpg  thanks for uploading image wonju jpg  i noticed that the file s description page currently doesn t specify who created the content  so the copyright status is unclear  if you did not create this file yourself  then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright  if you obtained it from a website  then a link to the website from which it was taken  together with a restatement of that website s terms of use of its content  is usually sufficient information  however  if the copyright holder is different from the website s publisher  then their copyright should also be acknowledged as well as adding the source  please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn t have one already  if you created took the picture  audio  or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the gfdl  if you believe the media meets the criteria at wikipedia fair use  use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at wikipedia image copyright tags fair use  see wikipedia image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use if you have uploaded other files  consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them  too  you can find a list of files you have uploaded by following this link unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged  as described on criteria for speedy deletion  if the image is copyrighted under a non free license  per wikipedia fair use  then the image will be deleted hours after if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page  thank you talk contribs

hey  what is it talk what is it  an exclusive group of some wp talibans who are good at destroying  self appointed purist who gang up any one who asks them questions abt their anti social and destructive  non  contribution at wp ask sityush to clean up his behavior than issue me nonsensical warnings 
before you start throwing accusations and warnings at me  lets review the edit itself making ad hominem attacks isn t going to strengthen your argument  it will merely make it look like you are abusing your power as an admin now  the edit itself is relevant this is probably the single most talked about event int he news as of late  his absence is notable  since he is the only living ex president who did not attend  that s certainly more notable than his dedicating an aircracft carrier i intend to revert this edit  in hopes of attracting the attention of an admin that is willing to look at the issue itself  and not throw accusations around quite so liberally  perhaps  if you achieve a level of civility where you can do this  we can have a rational discussion on the topic and resolve the matter peacefully 
oh  and the girl above started her arguments with me  she stuck her nose where it doesn t belong  i believe the argument was between me and yvesnimmo  but like i said  the situation was settled and i apologized  thanks

 re considering  st paragraph edit  i don t understand the reasons for  s recent edit of this article  not that i m sure that the data are necessarily wrong  rather  i m persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject i note that articles about other sitting justices have been similarly enhanced and i also believe those changes are no improvement  in support of my view that this edit should be reverted  i would invite anyone to re visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists a benjamin cardozo  a learned hand b john marshall harlan  b john marshall harlan ii  the question becomes  would the current version of the wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph i think not perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument kathleen sullivan of stanford law makes when she suggests that some on the harvard law faculty wonder how antonin scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging i would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point  less humorous  but an even stronger argument is the one clarence thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to yale at a minimum  i m questioning this edit it deserves to be reconsidered

there s no need to apologize  a wikipedia article is made for reconciling knowledge about a subject from different sources  and you ve done history studies and not archaeology studies  i guess  i could scan the page  e mail it to you  and then you could ask someone to  trans late the page

i was able to post the above list so quickly because i already had it in a text file in my hard drive  i ve been meaning to get around to updating the sound list for some time now as far as generating interest  i ve spent four years trying to drum up more interest in freely licensed full length classical music  unfortunately  my attempts failed i m still effectively the only one who does it  the classical music wikiproject was not interested wikipedia talk wikiproject classical music archive need help wikipedia talk wikiproject music archive i could use some helpwikipedia talk wikiproject music archive raulbot  c and the music list  so i really had given up trying to interest others  the sound list was featured on digg a while back http digg com music wikipedia has free classical music downloads it got diggs  which is imo very impressive

 not at all  you are making a straw man argument here  i never claimed o donohue had that position  rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the dsm position  which is exactly what the quote says and also something o donohue agrees with  again  i was combating the notion that it was a absurd part to claim that pedophilia is a  sex  orientation  since many researchers hold this position  it would be unfair to call it absurd  the disorder part is divided in the field  some argue that it is not a disorder at all  some do  at the end of the day  it is a value judgment  as cantor pointed out earlier in the thread not a scientific judgement  if we choose to make this value judgment in the article  it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis  
 mainland asia includes the lower basin of china s yangtze river as well as korea but being specific is fine too i just found a citation for a more comprehensive dna study by hammer below  rather than our generarizations and speculation so far  citation for yayoi culture was brought to japan by migrants from korea  who in turn trace their roots to southeast asia south china dna study by hammer  describes the yayoi migration from korea based on the o sry genes and other genes with close lineage  haplogroups o m and o m reiterates that the entire o haplogroup has been proposed to have a southeast asian origin  their definition of southeast asia includes southern china then hypothesizes that the dispersals of neolithic farmers from southeast asia also brought haplogroup o lineages to korea and eventually to japan  in the concluding paragraph  it states we propose that the yayoi y chromosomes descend from prehistoric farmers that had their origins in southeastern asia  perhaps going back to the origin of agriculture in this region  hammer s dna study is based on a global sample consisted of males from asian populations  including six populations sampled from across the japanese archipelago

i don t believe the lisak criticism present there conforms with the npv rule lisak doesn t have a neutral point of view to begin with if an offer to polygraph or even concerned review of polygraph results shocks a complainant into thinking her lies have been uncovered  the recantation is still perfectly valid if you know you are telling the truth  you will argue with machine or investigator also part of kanin s research was a followup of the recanted story where possible to verify if any were false recantations in all followups the recanted version of events matched what the accused said happened arguing that lisak is a respected phd is baseless if kanin is a respected phd i agree that my edit wasn t as neutral as possible though  so apologize for that still something must be done here 
you had a point  and it s now ammended with appropriate encyclopedic notability significance 
in other words  you re too lazy to actually point anything out  until you change that approach  the tag goes 
  as for your claims of stalking that is absolute rubbish and serves only to aggravate the situation  i have assumed good faith  and good intentions  on your part  and have never suggested  or seen reason to suggest  that you might have some ulterior motive in mass adding links to one specific company s web page  nor  for that matter  have i ever made any suggestion that this is an administrative matter or even mentioned such a role clearly  as a party to this disagreement  i would not do so at any rate as it would be a conflict of interest i would ask that you thus extend the same good faith toward me  rather than making spurious and unfounded accusations  chatspy 
 jmabel  in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims despite third way rhetoric  fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a right wing force as far as i m aware  owning numerous books on the subject  that is not the scholary consensus at all  the consensus  developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as roger griffin  hamish mcdonald  roger eatwell and zeev sternhell all recongise fascism as a third way as the references show the only dissenters i m aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible  this of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books  for example  even the foremost scholary expert on fascism  and a former member of both the communist party and then socialist party of italy  renzo de felice doesn t try to cover up its socialistic origins and third way status  this is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on mussolini 
 bi  you said you wanted to talk  at the bottom of the lead section you have written its promoter speculated in that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator  but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts  in addition  the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials regarding in addition  the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials that statement appears to come from ref on page the full quote is if the mass of the tether alone started to exceed times the mass of the payload  then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials  although the application might become feasible in the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher operational temperatures  it then goes on to say as we shall see  presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the hastol tethers needed  the primary message we want to leave with the reader is we don t need magic materials like buckminster fuller carbon nanotubes to make the space tether facility for a hastol system  existing materials will do  so it would appear that you misread your reference the tether mass of times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem systems where the tether mass is less than times the payload mass can be built with presently available commercial materials  to further reinforce this the conclusion to the report states the fundamental conclusion of the phase i hastol study effort is that the concept is technically feasible  we have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will allow hypersonic air breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting  spinning space tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the earth into earth orbit  for more than one hastol architecture concept  we have developed a design solution using existing  or near term technologies  we expect that a number of the other hastol architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to detailed design studies  the systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically reducing the cost of earth to orbit space access  regarding but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts  and a boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that in general  the non spinning tether hyperskyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts the full quote is hyperskyhook  in zubrin proposed the hypersonic skyhook as a solution to the mismatch between the attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers  since the orbital speed of the space tether decreases with increasing altitu

 is it scientific to attribute an event a  to cause b  where cause b was deliberate designed  with some sort of intelligent intent  don t answer the questions beyond that well  the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged  there are several major fundamental problems here  first  you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth  natural science might look at a honeycomb  see it is built by bees  and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb  and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees  that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth  id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here  this is not science in any sense of the word  it is mythology  when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox  they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes  no evidence of paul and his ox remain  i mean  really  second  natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable  theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up  id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally  how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria  if you don t understand it  you can t do statistics on it  id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn t have a complete  detailed  natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well  it s so improbable for this to happen  that someone must have designed it this is such a perversion of science  you can assign probabilities to something you don t understand  id is just making up their numbers  finally  your example has a  b  where b was deliberate design  that s all well and good for a rigged example  except that with respect to life on earth  b is unknown  your a  b example might qualify as forensic science  if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart  you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart  the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart  you can probably figure that s what killed him  you don t have that with life on earth  you have one scenario  a and you have no other cases to observe or test  so  in that sense  a  b is not scientific if you ve never actually observed b btw  b is teh intelligent designer  which has never been observed so  in that sense  no  it isn t science

lack of balance  this article is seriously out of balance it would benefit greatly from the introduction of additional information about the negative aspects of the t just for the record  this sort of balance problem is not uncommon when there is an over dependence on the works of a particular author for example  testing and evaluation of a t by the us army ordnance dept  exposed some very serious problems with the tank this type of information should be included in the article to bring it back into balance 
 thanks  i can see that violating clearly stated wikipedia policy is no problem with some people  as is now being reviewed elsewhere  finishing up one other wiki project todsy and then spending the rest of the day on an important personal blog entry then i ll go find other discussions of james petras  fascinating discussion of the use of the term jew ish lobby so that i don t have to put back up the deleted dissident voice article right away per talk jew ish lobby wp v comparing jewish virtual library and dissident voice  carol moore  talk

i tend to think that when the list is longer than the rest of the article  there s a problem either the history and characteristics should be expanded  of the list should be culled i personally like the consensus that was reached in the tripel article between  and others myself included we decided that the country of origin should be highlighted with the most examples there we did trappist  abbey  and foreign foreign includes all non belgium examples this way the article is an article in an encyclopedia  not a list people can find lists anywhere  and the article should reference this also  the style statistics are bad when you say style statistics  it sounds like a prescription  not a description an encyclopedia should follow the latter  and if the former is used  a citation should follow and you ll not find a valid one for this style in it s country of origin 
 what s up with this if you are a religiously or politically motivated to push this or that issue  please refrain from talking on my page  i am not interested  otherwise  feel free to talk about relevant edits here or science  deleet  talk i would prefer if the following users never post here  maunus aunus  snun  w weijibaikebianji this guy is a published psychology researcher right  perhaps he doesn t know you have access to libraries and the best sources  you should point that out more often  it doesn t come across as mind bendingly condescending  also i suspect that editor is a racist  see you on the wiki

including some appropriate mention of the solomon article is not without some level of support  
 comment  i could not verify the claim  talk 
 czech republic is in central europe  the state of this article is part of the reason why people are making such confusions  especially more ridiculous is that they you would replace the mention of north caucasus in favor of north slope of caucasus mountains which isnt even a geographical area other than denoting the mountains in that region  countries are located within continents  yet for some reason you refuse to allow this article to be denoted a continent  this single factor alone would have made a massive difference for readers  i m tired of arguing with people who are essentially wiki squatters refusing to nudge on a given article 
thanks  josette  i enjoyed meeting you  too  i was shocked by the decision  which does not begin to reflect consensus  does just one grand poobah make it alone  serves me right for stealing time from more pressing real world duties to indulge in a fun hobby  i ve learned my lesson and won t waste time like that again  i ll stick to fixing the little things i run across as i read articles for my own information 
paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized however  the term fossilized is not a very precise term there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate  invertebrates  radiolarians  sponges  plants  pollen  foot prints  etc and multiple processes may include permineralization  recrystalization  carbonization  replacement  dissolving  diagenesis  etc talking about fossilization is a complex issue  however quick burial is not questioned the major question is  how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab  which of course implies that given the right conditions  vast ages are not an issue the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood  but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains yet  how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with
